### ( Routing)

The use of routing is a technique for selecting how an application should respond to HTTP request method GET, POST and DELETE from a client. 

We may use the Router method that provided by Express.js to simplify the request process, when we have routes that are the same such as:

---javascript
app.get('/item',(req, res) => {
})

app.post('/item',(req, res) => {
})

app.delete('/item',(req, res) => {
})
---


We can combine both of them with a route method as the following:

---javascript
app.route('/item')
.get( (req, res) => {
  res.send('Get a random item')
})
.post( (req, res) => {
  res.send('Add a item')
})
.delete( (req, res) => {
  res.send('Delete a random item')
})
